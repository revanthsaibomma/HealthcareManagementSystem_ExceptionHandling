# 🏥 Healthcare Management System Using Python

## 📌 Project Overview

The **Healthcare Management System** is a menu-driven Python application developed to manage patients, doctors, appointments, billing, and healthcare reports.

The project demonstrates core Python concepts such as:

* Functions
* User-defined Modules
* Lists
* Dictionaries
* Loops
* Conditional Statements
* Exception Handling
* Logging
* Input Validation
* Business Logic

This project does **not** use file handling, databases, classes, or external libraries. All data is stored temporarily in Python lists while the application is running.
